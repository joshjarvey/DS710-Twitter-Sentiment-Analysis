# DS710 - Using Twitter Data to Analyze Sentiment with a Statistical Approach

In this project I used the Twitter REST API to collect tweets on the subject of interest, clean them, and process the text through an NLP package in Python called TextBlob, which scores the body of text on polarity ranging between -1 and 1. I also iterate through the entire corpus to count frequency of character name. Both datasets are stored to a .CSV.

Next, I import both .CSV files into R to complete statistical tests to answer the original business questions, and provide visuals to support my findings. 

Thanks for checking out the report!
